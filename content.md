### Option B: "The Scale Story"

Emphasises the pilot-to-scale journey that defines your career.

**Headline:**
> From prototype to scale.

**Subhead:**
> I take manufacturing technology that works in the lab and make it run 24/7 across continents. Currently building robotic construction systems at AUAR.

**Animated ticker or rotating text:**
- "Currently: Deploying micro-factories across Europe and North America"
- - "Previously: Industry 4.0 across 14 global sites"

- "Before that: Assembled the world's largest jet engine"

**CTA:** "How I work →" | "Let's talk →"

## Hero Visual Concepts

### Concept 1: Robotic Arm Response

A simplified, stylised robotic arm illustration that subtly tracks cursor movement or responds to scroll. Not photorealistic—more technical drawing or wireframe aesthetic.

- Resting state: arm in neutral position
- On interaction: follows cursor with slight delay, mechanical easing
- On scroll: arm "points" toward content below

**Tech:** SVG + Framer Motion or GSAP

## Credentials Strip (Below Hero)

Horizontal band with logos or text—social proof at a glance.


**Option C: Hybrid**
> Built with: [RR logo] [Edwards logo] [BCG logo] [AUAR logo]
> Recognised by: Manufacturer Top 100 · Young Manufacturer of the Year

---

## Navigation Concept

**Minimal top bar:**
- Logo/name (left): "Tom d'Arcy" or "TD" mark
- Nav items (right): About · Work · Writing · Contact
- Optional: dark/light mode toggle styled as industrial switch

**Alternative: hidden nav**
- No visible nav on landing
- Appears on scroll or hamburger menu
- Hero stays completely clean

## Mobile Adaptation

- Headline stacks full-width
- Visual element either: (a) moves above headline, (b) becomes subtle background, or (c) simplifies to static image
- Stats become vertical list or 2×2 grid
- CTAs stack vertically
- Credentials strip becomes scrollable horizontal ticker

---

## My Recommendation

**Copy:** Option A or D—both are punchy and memorable. Option A is safer, Option D is bolder. Depends how much you want to stand out versus play it straight.

**Visual:** Concept 3 (Blueprint Reveal)—distinctive, on-brand, achievable complexity. The robotic arm (Concept 1) is great but risks feeling gimmicky if not executed perfectly. Blueprint feels more sophisticated.

**Layout:** Clean split (text left, visual right) with credentials strip below. Proven structure, lets the content and animation do the work.

Want me to develop the winning combination in more detail, draft the mobile treatment, or move into code scaffolding?

## Section 2: About

### Headline Options

**Option C:** "Taking manufacturing tech from pilot to scale"

### Core Narrative (conversational, ~150 words)

I'm an operations leader who specialises in the messy middle—taking cutting-edge manufacturing technology from "it works in the lab" to "it's running 24/7 across 14 sites."

My career started on the factory floor at Rolls-Royce, where I eventually led the team assembling the world's largest jet engine. I've since driven Industry 4.0 transformation across 12 countries, optimised pharmaceutical supply chains at BCG, and now I'm building robotic manufacturing systems at AUAR that are changing how we construct buildings.

What makes me different: I write Python and I run P&Ls. I can debug a PLC and present to a board. That bridge between the technical and the commercial is where I do my best work.

When I'm not on a factory floor, I'm probably in my workshop—woodworking, welding, or building something that didn't exist yesterday.

## Featured Project: Case Study Format (Optional Deep Dive)

### UltraFan: Building the World's Largest Jet Engine

**The challenge**
Rolls-Royce needed to assemble and test prototype demonstrators of UltraFan—a next-generation jet engine with a 140-inch fan diameter—on an aggressive timeline tied to board milestones and CEO commitments.

**My role**
I led the DemoWorks facility: a 24/7 R&D factory operation with ~50 people, full P&L ownership, and direct accountability to programme leadership.

**What we delivered**
- Met every critical milestone on the path to first engine run
- Stood up digital systems (MES) to replace paper-based tracking
- Built a team culture that thrived under pressure

**What I learned**
Running a factory that's building something that's never existed before is fundamentally different from steady-state production. You're constantly balancing schedule pressure against technical unknowns, and your job is to create the conditions where your team can solve problems faster than they emerge.

## Implementation Notes

**About section:**
- Hero image: You in a technical environment (factory floor, with robot, in workshop)—not a headshot against white background
- Consider a subtle animated element behind the text (grid lines, particle system)
- "Quick facts" block works well as a card or sidebar element

**Experience section:**
- Horizontal scroll on desktop creates memorable interaction; vertical cards on mobile
- Each "station" could have a subtle entry animation (slide in, fade up)
- Icons or small illustrations for each company add visual interest
- Timeline connector line styled as a conveyor belt or production line

**Case study:**
- Start with one (UltraFan is your strongest story)
- Can add AUAR V3 once you're ready to share more publicly
- Format as expandable accordion or separate page
