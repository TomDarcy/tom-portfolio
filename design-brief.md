# Personal Website Design Brief: Tom d'Arcy

## Strategic Intent

**Core positioning:** You're not a typical operations leader—you're the person who takes bleeding-edge manufacturing technology and makes it actually work at scale. The site should communicate that you operate at the intersection of physical robotics and digital systems, with the credibility of serious industrial delivery and the energy of someone building the future.

**Target audience:** Potential collaborators, investors, talent you want to recruit, and industry peers. Secondary: speaking/advisory opportunities.

## Design Concept: "Precision Meets Personality"

### Visual Direction

**Primary aesthetic:** Industrial-technical with warmth. Think factory floor meets design studio—clean lines, purposeful typography, but with moments of delight and humanity.

**Colour palette:**
- Deep charcoal/navy as primary base (suggests precision, engineering rigour)
- Electric accent colour—either a warm orange/amber (robotic arm joints, safety equipment) or electric blue (digital/AI)
- Crisp white for breathing room
- Subtle grid overlays or technical drawing motifs as texture

**Typography:**
- Headlines: Something geometric and engineered (Space Grotesk, DM Sans, or IBM Plex Sans)
- Body: Clean, highly readable (Inter or similar)
- Optional: Monospace for technical callouts or data points

### Interactive Elements & "Fun Factor"

**Hero section ideas:**
- Animated robotic arm that follows cursor movement subtly, or responds to scroll
- Particle system forming into structured patterns (chaos → order metaphor)
- Technical blueprint/schematic that "builds" as you scroll into view
- Typing animation revealing key stats: "14 sites. 12 countries. One engine the size of a house."

**Micro-interactions:**
- Hover states that feel mechanical—slight "click" animations, servo-movement easing
- Progress indicators styled as factory loading bars or robot calibration sequences
- Section transitions that feel like machine movements—precise, purposeful, satisfying

**Personality moments:**
- Easter egg: Konami code reveals something unexpected (perhaps a photo with a robot, or a "debug mode" view of the site)
- "Currently building" live status section—what you're working on right now at AUAR
- A "factory tour" scroll experience for your career timeline—each role as a "station"

## Site Architecture

### Pages/Sections

**1. Home / Hero**
- Punchy headline capturing your positioning
- Animated visual element
- Quick-hit credentials (awards, key stats)
- Clear CTAs to key sections

**2. About**
- Your story arc: apprentice → global ops leader → startup builder
- What makes you different (hands-on technical fluency + strategic thinking)
- Personal interests that humanise (woodworking, the maker mentality)
- Photo that shows personality, ideally in a technical environment

**3. Experience / Work**
- Not a CV dump—curated highlights with impact metrics
- Visual timeline or "factory floor" metaphor
- Case study cards for 2-3 signature projects (UltraFan, Industry 4.0 rollout, AUAR V3)

**4. Writing / Thinking** *(optional but recommended)*
- Place for industry perspectives, lessons learned
- Establishes thought leadership
- Could start simple and grow

**5. Contact**
- Clean, simple
- LinkedIn prominent
- Perhaps a "what I'm open to" section (advisory, speaking, collaboration)

## Technical Specifications

**Build approach:**
- Static site generator (Astro, Next.js, or similar) for speed and simplicity
- Deployed on Github Pages as static site
- Minimal dependencies—should load fast and feel premium

**Animation libraries:**
- Framer Motion or GSAP for interactions
- Three.js only if you commit to a 3D element (robotic arm, particle system)—otherwise keep it CSS/SVG for performance

**Responsive:**
- Mobile-first but desktop experience can have richer interactions
- Key content and CTAs must work perfectly on mobile

---

## Content Tone

**Voice:** Confident but not boastful. Technical but accessible. Serious about the work, not too serious about yourself.

**Avoid:**
- Corporate jargon soup
- "Passionate about..." clichés
- Walls of text

**Embrace:**
- Specific numbers and outcomes
- Active voice ("Led," "Built," "Delivered")
- Moments of wit in microcopy

## Success Metrics

The site works if:
1. Someone understands your unique positioning within 10 seconds
2. It feels distinctly *you*—not a template
3. It invites conversation and connection
4. You're proud to share it
