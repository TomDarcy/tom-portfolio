# The Emotional Impact of Poorly Designed Manufacturing Software

There's a visceral feeling that comes with using poorly designed software – that creeping frustration as you watch yet another loading screen, the subtle anxiety before clicking a button because you're not quite sure what it will do, the defeated sigh when you have to start a process over because the system lost your work. In manufacturing environments, where every minute counts, these daily digital friction points don't just waste time – they slowly erode confidence in our digital transformation efforts and create a culture of reluctant technology adoption.

## A Common Scenario of Frustration

Picture this: An operator spends precious minutes navigating through multiple screens of a Manufacturing Execution System (MES), carefully entering data about the latest production run. Then, needing to check something from two screens back, they hit the back button. Instead of returning to their previous page, they're suddenly thrown back to the application's login screen, losing all their entered data. Now they must start the entire process again, watching loading screens tick by with growing frustration. You can feel their enthusiasm for digital tools diminishing with each passing second.

This isn't a hypothetical scenario – it's a real example from an implementation of a poorly designed MES system which frustrated operators daily. It’s not just the lost time this causes – it creates a tangible sense of disconnection between workers and their digital tools. Instead of technology feeling like a natural extension of their work, it becomes an obstacle to overcome.

## The Historical Prioritisation of Functionality

The manufacturing industry has historically prioritised functionality above all else in its software solutions, and for good reason. When managing complex production processes, precision and reliability are paramount. However, this focus often came at the cost of usability.

Industry research from the Manufacturing Institute suggests that while 85% of manufacturers recognise digitalisation as important, only 34% report successful digital transformation initiatives. A significant factor in this gap? Poor software usability.

## The Contrast with Modern Software Experiences

Compare this to the fluid experience of using a well-designed app on your smartphone. There's a certain joy in using software that just works – when buttons respond instantly, when interfaces guide you naturally through complex tasks, when mistakes are easily undone. This isn't just about aesthetics; it's about creating a relationship of trust between users and their tools. When software feels good to use, it becomes an ally in getting work done rather than an adversary to be battled.

## The Roots of the Problem

The roots of this problem trace back to the early days of manufacturing software development. As factories began digitalising in the 1980s and 1990s, the primary focus was simply getting systems to work reliably in industrial environments. Software interfaces were often designed by engineers for engineers, with little consideration for the emotional impact on the diverse range of users who would ultimately need to interact with these systems daily.

Recent studies highlight the cost of this approach. According to a 2023 report by Deloitte, manufacturing companies lose an average of 47 hours per employee annually due to poorly designed software interfaces. But behind this statistic lies a deeper truth: when workers dread using their digital tools, they're less likely to embrace new technologies, less inclined to suggest improvements, and more likely to develop workarounds that bypass digital systems entirely.

## Cognitive Dissonance and Frustration

The contrast with modern consumer and enterprise software is stark. While manufacturing operators struggle with unintuitive interfaces, their smartphones offer experiences that feel almost magical in their simplicity. This disparity creates a cognitive dissonance – workers know better tools are possible because they use them every day in their personal lives. This awareness makes the frustration of using poorly designed manufacturing software even more acute.

## Lessons from the Tech Industry

Consider how the tech industry has evolved. We might not all love it, but Microsoft Teams has revolutionised workplace communication by making complex features feel effortless and even enjoyable to use. You can switch between chat, file sharing, and video calls in such an intuitive manner that training just isn’t required. Manufacturing software can adopt these same principles while maintaining its industrial capabilities.

## The Benefits of User-Centric Design

The good news is that change is possible, and the benefits extend far beyond metrics. When we implement user-centric manufacturing software, we see not just improved efficiency but a fundamental shift in how people relate to technology on the shop floor. Teams become more confident in trying new digital tools, more eager to suggest improvements, and more likely to view technology as an enabler rather than a barrier.

In our own experience implementing user-centric manufacturing software, we've seen:

- **Reduced training time** when interfaces follow familiar patterns, creating a sense of intuitive understanding.
- **Decreased error rates in data entry** with clearer visual hierarchies, reducing the stress of data input.
- **Increased system adoption rates** when workflows mirror actual user behaviour, fostering a positive relationship with digital tools.

## The Future of Manufacturing Software

The manufacturing industry stands at a crucial juncture. As we continue to digitalise our operations, we must recognise that the feel of our software – its responsiveness, its intuitiveness, its ability to delight rather than frustrate – is just as important as its functional capabilities. When we prioritise creating software that people genuinely enjoy using, we don't just improve efficiency – we transform the entire cultural relationship with technology on the shop floor.

The next generation of manufacturing software must recognise that every moment of friction in an interface isn't just lost time – it's a missed opportunity to build trust and enthusiasm for digital transformation. When we make our systems more intuitive and enjoyable to use, we create an environment where technology becomes a natural, welcomed part of the manufacturing process rather than an imposed burden.
