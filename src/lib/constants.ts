  narrative: `I write Python and I run factories. I can debug machine code and present to a board. That bridge between the technical and the operational is where I do my best work.

My career started on the shop floor at Rolls-Royce, where I eventually led the team assembling the world's largest jet engine. I've since driven Industry 4.0 transformation across 12 countries, optimised pharmaceutical production lines at BCG, and now I'm building robotic construction systems at AUAR.

The gap between "it works in the lab" and "it's running 24/7 across 14 sites" is where most innovation dies — and it's where I've spent my entire career.

When I'm not on a factory floor, I'm probably in my workshop—woodworking, welding, or building something that didn't exist yesterday.`,
